## Commit messages style
All commit messages should look like:\
`type(date): <quick message>`\
where `date` is a due date of the task in dd.mm.yyyy format and `type` could be on of the following:
|type|explanation|
|----|-----------|
| CW | a ClassWork|
| HW | a HomeWork (exactly, some code) |
| AN | for analytical calculations |
| RE | for refactoring: this type has no due date |
